        <h2>Spaghetti carbonara</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a beautiful, classic Italian pasta that’s so creamy, you’d swear there’s a good amount of cream in it. And indeed, there’s plenty of recipes that cheat by adding in cream.

            But today, we’re making spaghetti carbonara properly, the authentic, traditional way. No cream. Just egg, cheese and a splash of starchy pasta cooking water.
            
            15 minutes later, THIS is the sight that will be in front of you. And you’ll make 60 million Italians beam with pride!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>175g/6 oz guanciale (pancetta or block bacon)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>100g/3.5 oz parmigiano reggiano</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>400g/14 oz spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cooking/kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Guanciale – Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
            <li>Carbonara sauce – Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta – Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
            <li>Reserve pasta water – Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>Cook guanciale – While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed – as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
            <li>Pasta in pan – Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
            <li>Mix pasta in sauce – Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
            <li>Serve – Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
        </ol>
