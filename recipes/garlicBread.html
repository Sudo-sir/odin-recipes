            <li>1/2 cup softened unsalted butter (can also use salted)</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Slice bread in half lengthwise and place on a large baking sheet, cut sides up.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix butter, garlic, parsley and salt together until well combined. Spread evenly over bread.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes or until slightly golden brown on the edges. If you want to add cheese, add it the last 2 minutes of baking. If you like a crispier garlic bread, bake for 3-5 minutes more, watching carefully until it is as golden as you like.</li>
